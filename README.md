# pdf-rs
Read, alter and write PDF files.

**At the moment, you can only read PDF files.**

One easy way you can contribute is to add different PDF files to `tests/files` and see if they pass the tests (`cargo test`).

Feel free to contribute with ideas, issues or code! You can also [join the discussion](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=rust-pdf) on `#rust-pdf` on `irc.oftc.net`.

# Inspect
There is a tool for visualizing a PDF file as an interactive hierarchy of primitives at [inspect-prim](https://github.com/pdf-rs/inspect-prim). Just clone and `cargo run`.
