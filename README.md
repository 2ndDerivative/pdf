# pdf-rs
Read, alter and write PDF files.

At the moment, you can only read PDF files. We are working on also writing/altering PDF files.

One easy way you can contribute is to add different PDF files to `tests/files` and see if they pass the tests (`cargo test`).

Development is mainly happening in the `dev` branch.

We should perhaps make a checklist here of features, such as what filter we have implemented etc.

Feel free to contribute with ideas, issues or code!
