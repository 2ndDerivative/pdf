# pdf-rs
The plan is to make a library in Rust, that can read, alter and write PDF files.

I'm still working on parsing and properly loading different PDF files. Right now, I'm working on reading xref streams.

## Looking for contributors

Everything is open for discussion. I have mostly been occupied with getting things to work and reassuring that my understanding (in the form of algorithms) is in line with existing PDF files.

The code isn't that tidy but that will improve when I get down the basics and decide on how to do everything.
