Read, alter and write PDF files.

At the moment, you can only read PDF files. We are working on also writing/altering PDF files. On the reading side, some work is to be done with encoding. Currently working on FlateDecode / PNG filters.

Development is mainly happening in the `dev` branch.

Feel free to contribute with ideas or code!
